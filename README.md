## üñ•Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Install XAMPP**:
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) if you don't already have it.
   - Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services from the XAMPP Control Panel.

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Create a new database named **`crud`**.
   - Inside the `crud` database, create a table named **`books`** with the following structure:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE books (
         id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         description TEXT NOT NULL
     );
     ```

3. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Clone this repository or download the project files.
   - Place the project folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\crud-project`).

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/crud-project` (replace `crud-project` with the name of your project folder).
   - You should see the CRUD interface ready to use!
